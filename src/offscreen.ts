// queued behind it — and the agent's own ledger writes are SQL. Two workers, two queues.
//
// Same URL trick as above (`runtime.getURL`) and for the same reason: a `?worker` import
// resolves to the dev server's origin in development, which Chrome refuses to load from a
// chrome-extension:// page.
//
// Responses are never chunked. A document result is a projection capped at a couple of
// tens of KB by `docx/project.ts` — the size limit that matters is the agent's round
// budget, which is far below anything `sendMessage` struggles with.

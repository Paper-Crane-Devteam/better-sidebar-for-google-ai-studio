/**
 * AgentPolicyControls — what the agent may do without asking.
 *
 * One switch per kind of tool call, which is the whole model: queries and changes.
 * Everything else about approval is a scope chosen at the moment of asking (this
 * call / the rest of this response / the rest of this task), so it belongs on the
 * approval prompt, not here.
 *
 * Plus "keep going on its own", which is a different axis: whether the loop may run
 * unattended at all. It intersects with the two above rather than overriding them
 * (see `shouldAutoSend`), so it can only ever make things more manual. The note under
 * it spells out the part the labels don't: approving a step also hands you the send.
 *
 * These are long-standing preferences, so by rights they belong in Settings → Agent,
 * next to skills and tools. They're behind the dock's gear for now because that
 * settings section doesn't exist yet (the feature still borrows the slash-command
 * flag). Folded away by default either way: the moment anyone wants them is the
 * moment they're tired of being asked, and that moment happens right here.

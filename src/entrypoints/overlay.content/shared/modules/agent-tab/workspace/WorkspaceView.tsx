/**
 * WorkspaceView — the Agent tab, showing files instead of the launcher.
 *
 * Replaces the tab's contents rather than opening a dialog or claiming a tab of its own.
 * The workspace only means anything in the context of the agent that writes to it, and a
 * sidebar this narrow has no room for a second panel.
 *
 * ## No longer read-only
 *
 * It began as a viewer on the assumption that the agent is the only author. That held
 * until the workspace had to be somewhere you *put* things — reference notes, a spec, a
 * CSV to work through — at which point a browser-private filesystem with no way in and no
 * way out was the feature's main limitation rather than a detail of it. So: create,
 * rename, move, delete, upload by picker or by drop, download one entry or the whole tree
 * as a ZIP.
 *
 * ## Composition
 *
 * This file is layout and workspace-level concerns only. The three things with real logic
 * live next door, because each is substantial enough to reason about on its own:
 *
 * - `useWorkspaceFiles` — listing, tree assembly, search filtering.
 * - `WorkspaceFileTree` — per-entry filesystem operations, and the tree itself.
 * - `useWorkspaceTransfer` — upload and export, with their progress and reporting.

/**
 * AgentLauncher — the Agent tab before anything is running.
 *
 * It is no longer a launcher in the sense of a second place to start a task. It had a
 * textarea and a list of skill cards, which made the sidebar an entry point competing
 * with `>` in the chat input: the same action, reached two ways, with the sidebar one
 * having to forward text into the composer and report every way that can fail. The skill
 * list was the same duplication one level down — the `>` picker already lists skills, and
 * the auto entry picks one for you, so choosing here bought nothing and implied the
 * choice mattered.
 *
 * What is left reads top to bottom as one thought: how to start (`LauncherCta`), what to
 * say (`LauncherExamples`), and then the two places you go that are not a task. The
 * destinations sit last because they are only interesting once the first two have been
 * read; workspace leads within them, because looking at files is something you do
 * repeatedly and configuring tools is something you do once.
 *
 * The examples still stage into the chat input, so the entry point stays single — the
 * sidebar fills the composer and hands it back, rather than sending on its own.
 *
 * ## One padding, no outlines
 *
 * The tab owns the horizontal padding (`px-3`) and nothing inside adds a second one.
 * Sections are text on the panel; where a tinted surface is needed it uses `-mx-2 px-2`,
 * so the tint bleeds outward and the content stays on the same left edge as everything
 * above it. Before that rule, each section sat on a filled card with its own `p-3` inside
 * the tab's, and on a panel this narrow the doubled inset cost most of a line's width and
 * read as clutter.
 *
 * Nothing is outlined either — an earlier pass bordered every block and the tab became
 * nested frames a few pixels apart. Same reason the two destinations are full-width rows
 * instead of a two-column grid: side by side, each got about twenty characters of width
 * and both labels wrapped.
 *
 * With no frames left, the sections are told apart by the space between them alone, which
 * is why the column gap is a deliberate `gap-6` rather than the `gap-3` that looked fine
 * while every block still had an edge to hold it in. The two content sections label
 * themselves and keep that label tight against their own content, so the gap here always
 * reads as "new section" rather than as air between a heading and what it introduces.

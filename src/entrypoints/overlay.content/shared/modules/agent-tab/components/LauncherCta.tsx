/**
 * The one instruction the Agent tab exists to give: type `>` in the chat input.
 *
 * It replaced a textarea. A box in the sidebar looked like the place the agent lived,
 * when the agent has always run through the page's own composer — so the box had to
 * forward what you typed into that composer, and every failure mode of doing so (no chat
 * open, a task already holding the composer) surfaced as an error on a control that
 * looked like it should just work. Showing the composer instead of standing in for it
 * removes the indirection and the class of error that came with it.
 *
 * The three steps are drawn rather than described, because "type `>`" is a keystroke and a
 * picker, and a mock of both is read faster than a sentence about them.
 *
 * ## Why step 2 looks different
 *
 * Steps 1 and 3 are things the user already knows how to do — open a chat, type a request.
 * Step 2 is the only new information on this panel, and the only thing that will not
 * happen by accident. So it is the one that is set in the accent colour, a size up and
 * semibold, with a filled step badge; 1 and 3 stay muted. At a glance the panel reads as
 * "type `>`", with the other two steps as context.
 *
 * The emphasis is type and colour, not a filled band. A tint behind one of three steps
 * reads as a separate card wedged into a list and re-introduces the nested-box look this
 * panel was flattened to avoid.
 *
 * ## Flat, and only one padding
 *
 * No outlines: a sidebar this narrow puts every card edge within a few pixels of the next
 * one, and stacking outlined boxes turned the tab into a grid of competing frames.
 *
 * No wrapper surface either. These three steps used to sit on a tinted card with its own
 * `p-3`, inside the tab's `px-3` — two paddings on a panel about 300px wide, which reads
 * as cramped and buys nothing, since the steps are the only thing at that level anyway.
 * The only fills left are the two small mocks inside step 2, and those are drawings of the
 * page's composer and picker rather than decoration.

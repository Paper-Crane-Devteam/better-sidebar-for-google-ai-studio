/**
 * Execution policy — decides which tool calls need the user's go-ahead, and as a
 * direct consequence, who presses send at the end of the round.
 *
 * One question, asked per call: may this run without asking? Four inputs, checked
 * from broadest to narrowest:
 *
 * 1. `speedMode`          — approved everything for this task (session)
 * 2. `approveRestOfRound` — approved the rest of this response (cleared each round)
 * 3. `autoRunWrites`      — changes to data run by themselves (persisted, off)
 * 4. `autoRunReads`       — queries run by themselves (persisted, on)
 *
 * The gate itself lives in the engine (`stages/approval-gate.ts`), not in the tools.
 * `execute-sql` used to ask for its own confirmation, which meant a tool reaching
 * into the UI and left the request with no way to say *which* call it was about —
 * so the approval couldn't be offered on the tool card in the chat.

 * - `control` — the call does nothing to the data, it ends the loop. Filing
 *   `complete_task` under `read` meant "don't auto-run queries" also meant "ask me
 *   before finishing", which is a gate over an operation with no downside and no
 *   alternative: refusing it just makes the AI say the same thing again next round.
 * - `write`   — SQL that modifies data. Only that: `export` produces output but leaves
 *   the database alone, so gating it behind the write switch would train people to
 *   turn it on.
 * - `read`    — everything else.
 *
 * `sync_conversation_messages` sits awkwardly across this: it records messages, but
 * through the extension's normal capture path rather than SQL the user could read
 * first. It is handled by name in `requiresApproval` instead — see there.

 *    wants to watch each step before letting it continue turns this off, and does
 *    not thereby have to confirm every individual SELECT.
 * 2. The round itself — did anything here already stop and ask? A user who just
 *    approved a statement is sitting right there, so the send is theirs. Having it
 *    fly off the moment you clicked "Run" is the worse surprise; one extra keypress
 *    is the cheaper half of that trade.
 *
 * A response commonly mixes both kinds — two SELECTs and an UPDATE — and there is
 * only one send, so it goes to the user if *any* call needed them.
 * `approveRestOfRound` and `speedMode` fold in for free, since they make
 * `requiresApproval` false for the rest of the round.
 *
 * ⚠️ Intersection, not replacement. `autoSend = autoContinue` on its own lets the
 * switch contradict the approval gate; this way the switch can only ever make
 * things *more* manual.

/**
 * The same identity, short enough to travel inside a message.
 *
 * A fingerprint carries the whole SQL statement, so it cannot be written into the
 * results we send back to the AI. This is its digest: ten hex characters, which is
 * ample when the only thing it has to be unique across is the tool calls of one
 * conversation.
 *
 * Why a digest of the fingerprint rather than a random id minted per call: the card
 * in the chat has to find its own record, and a random id would only exist in our
 * database — a dangling pointer as soon as you open the conversation on another
 * machine, or after a restore that didn't carry these tables. A digest is
 * self-describing. The card recomputes it from the call it is already rendering and
 * matches on that, so the conversation alone is enough.
 *
 * ⚠️ It follows that `buildToolCallFingerprint` is now a *wire* format: change how it
 * normalises params and every key already written into a conversation stops matching.
 * `deriveToolOutcomes` falls back to its heuristic in that case, so the failure is
 * graceful rather than silent — but it is still a one-way door.
 *
 * Synchronous on purpose: `crypto.subtle.digest` is async, and this is called during
 * render. FNV-1a twice with different offset bases is not cryptography, and does not
 * need to be — nothing security-relevant rests on it, only which card lights up.

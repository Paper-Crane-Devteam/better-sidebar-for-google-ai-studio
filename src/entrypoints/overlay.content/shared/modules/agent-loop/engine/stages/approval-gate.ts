/**
 * Holding a tool call until the user says go.
 *
 * This used to live inside `execute-sql`, which had two consequences. A tool
 * reached into the UI to open a dialog, and the request carried only the SQL — no
 * way to say *which* call it belonged to. So approval could only ever be a separate
 * dialog describing the call second-hand, while the "Run" button sitting on the
 * call's own card in the chat was a completely independent path that appended its
 * result to the composer for the user to send by hand.
 *
 * Two ways to approve the same operation meant a ledger of executed fingerprints, a
 * disabled state while the engine was busy, and a check-then-act race between them.
 * All of that existed to keep the two paths from colliding.
 *
 * Now there is one path: the engine always executes, and the card button is how you
 * approve. Same promise, answered from wherever the user happens to be looking.

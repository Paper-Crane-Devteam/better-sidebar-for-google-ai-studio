/**
 * Stage ④ — get the round's results back to the AI.
 *
 * Three steps: stage the payload in the composer, park in `awaiting_send`, then
 * either click send or leave it to the user. Sending always goes through the real
 * send button so the capsule-merging interceptor runs.
 *
 * Who clicks is the caller's decision, passed in as `autoSend` — it follows from
 * whether anything this round needed approval (see `shouldAutoSend`). There used to
 * be a persisted `autoContinue` switch here instead, which could disagree with the
 * approval settings: approve a write by hand, and the results still went out on
 * their own.
 *
 * Stateful, unlike the other stages: between the stage and the confirmed send there
 * is a payload in limbo, and `resume` / `continueNow` need to know about it. That
 * pending text is the difference between "retry sends the results" and "retry waits
 * forever for an answer nobody asked for".

/**
 * Agent Loop Engine — the state machine, and nothing else.
 *
 * One round is four stages, and this file is only their ordering plus the
 * lifecycle entry points the UI calls (start / stop / resume / continueNow):
 *
 *   ① stages/await-response  wait for the AI to finish answering
 *   ② stages/parse-response  extract tool calls (or end the session)
 *   ③ stages/execute-tools   run them, guarded by the circuit breaker
 *   ④ stages/handoff         send the results back and confirm they left
 *
 * Everything the stages share — store, events, abort, circuit breaker — is reached
 * through `LoopContext`. Guards live in `guards/`, tool-call parsing in `parser/`.
 *
 * Two invariants worth knowing before changing anything here:
 *
 * - **A stage that already reported its own outcome returns a "stop" result.** When
 *   a stage pauses or ends the session it also emits the matching event, so the loop
 *   just returns instead of second-guessing it.
 * - **A failed handoff must stop the loop.** Continuing would wait for a reply to a
 *   message that was never delivered, which looks like a hang until the AI timeout.

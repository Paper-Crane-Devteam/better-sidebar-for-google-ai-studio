/**
 * AI Studio Platform Adapter.
 *
 * Differences from Gemini that the rest of the loop should not have to know about:
 *
 * - The composer is a plain `<textarea>`, so there are no result capsules. Staging
 *   falls back to plain text, which means the payload is *visible* in the input box
 *   while it waits — see `stageResults`.
 * - The Run button stays in the DOM and is disabled instead of removed, so `absent` is
 *   derived from `aria-disabled`. See `getRunState`.
 * - Turns are virtualised: `ms-chat-turn` elements persist but their `.turn-content` is
 *   only populated while the turn is near the viewport. Everything here reads the
 *   *newest* turn, which auto-scroll keeps on screen, so it is unaffected — but nothing
 *   in this file can be reused to read conversation history.

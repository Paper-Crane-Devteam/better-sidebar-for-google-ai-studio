/**
 * Reading the model's *literal* output back off a rendered response.
 *
 * Both platforms run the model's text through a markdown renderer before we ever see
 * it, and a renderer consumes its own syntax: `*{a,b}*` arrives in the DOM as
 * `<i>{a,b}</i>`, with the asterisks gone from the text entirely. `textContent` and
 * `innerText` therefore do not return what the model wrote — they return what is left
 * after markdown has eaten part of it.
 *
 * That is invisible in prose and fatal in a tool call. The failure that led here:
 *
 *     {"name":"glob_files","params":{"pattern":"*{架构,设计,template}*"}}
 *
 * parsed as valid JSON, ran, and answered `No files match "{架构,设计,template}"` —
 * a pattern with no wildcards left, against a workspace that did contain the file.
 * Nothing errored, and the sidebar showed the *correct* pattern back to the user,
 * because the conversation renderer converts the DOM to markdown (restoring the `*`)
 * while the agent loop read `innerText` (which does not). Same for a `grep_files`
 * regex like `.*`, an `edit_file` `old_string` containing `_`, and any SQL with two
 * `*` on one line.
 *
 * So the delimiters are put back before the text is parsed. `*` vs `_` is not
 * recoverable from `<i>` alone — the asterisk is chosen because it is the form that
 * carries meaning inside a glob, a regex and a SQL projection, and it matches what
 * `htmlToMarkdown` already shows in the sidebar.
 *
 * Fences are deliberately *not* restored: `<pre>` content comes back verbatim without
 * its ``` markers. Restoring them would let `isInsideCodeBlock` start discarding real
 * tool calls the moment a platform decided to render one as a code block.

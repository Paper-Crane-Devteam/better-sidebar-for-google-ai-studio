 * to the loop does not have to be made twice and cannot drift between agents.
 *
 * ⚠️ Anything agent-specific must **not** end up in this file. The tell is whether the

 * alone in its own response" is protocol; "always SELECT before you write" is the Better

 * them, so an agent can reorder, drop, or wrap any of them without a template engine.

Output tool calls in this exact format:

</bs_agent_tool>

Rules for tool call format:
- The outer \`<bs_agent_tool>\` wrapper is REQUIRED
- Inside must be a valid JSON object with "name", "description", and "params" fields
- "description" is REQUIRED — a short human-readable explanation
- Escape quotes inside all JSON strings (including summary/change_summary); use Chinese quotation marks 「…」 in prose to avoid nested double quotes. Do not Markdown-escape tag names or tool names.
- A param that takes a list is a real JSON array: \`"ids": ["a", "b"]\`. Never a quoted string \`"ids": "[...]"\` — the inner quotes come out unescaped and the entire tool call is discarded unparsed
- You can output multiple <bs_agent_tool> blocks in one response (executed in order)
- IMPORTANT: Always use <bs_agent_tool> tags (NOT <tool_call>)`;

allow or refuse, and they generally cannot read the SQL or the file body themselves.

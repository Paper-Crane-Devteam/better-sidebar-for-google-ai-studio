/**
 * Document tool providers.
 *
 * One tool, and that is a decision rather than a starting point. Five formats × "outline /
 * read a part / search" would be fifteen schemas in **every** prompt, for a capability
 * most sessions never use. `manage_files` already set the precedent: fold the variants
 * into a parameter and keep the prompt short.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This description is deliberately terse, and must stay that way.** The assembled
 * system prompt sits at roughly 29k of a ~30k ceiling (`prompts/initial-message.ts`), so
 * every character here is taken from the user's own request. The first draft of this
 * schema was 1249 characters and that alone pushed the message over the limit, which
 * silently dropped the user's task. Guidance that is better placed in a skill — how to
 * work through a document, what to do about tracked changes — belongs there, where it is
 * loaded on demand, not here where it is loaded always.

 * ⚠️ The `ops` description names the verbs and stops. The full parameter list per verb is
 * roughly 900 characters *per format* and lives in the `docx-review` and
 * `spreadsheet-analysis` skills instead — the model gets it by activating one, which is
 * exactly the trade the skill mechanism exists for: two cheap schemas always, thirty-odd
 * operations when they are needed. The cost of adding Excel to this schema was about 150
 * characters; adding its parameters would have been two thousand.
 *
 * `mode` is documented as an escape hatch rather than a choice, because the tool already
 * defaults to `track` and a schema that presents the two evenly is a schema that gets
 * `direct` half the time.

/**
 * Workspace MCP Server — "Agent Workspace".
 *
 * A second builtin server, parallel to `BUILTIN_MCP`, rather than more tools inside
 * it. Two consequences that are the point of the split:
 *
 * - It can be turned off. The file tools are useless to someone who only wants chat
 *   organisation, and seven extra tool schemas in every prompt is real token cost.
 * - `complete_task` and `activate_skill` stay in the core server, so the workspace
 *   agent still gets them — the loop cannot end without `complete_task`.

/**
 * Writing the session down as it happens.
 *
 * The engine knows a call by its round, its position in that round, and its join key.
 * The database wants row ids and a session id. This is the one place that translates,
 * so no stage has to carry database concerns through its own logic.
 *
 * **Every write is best-effort.** A failure here is logged and swallowed, because the
 * ledger is an aid, not the mechanism: without it the renderer falls back to reading
 * the transcript, which is what it did before this existed. Letting a rejected INSERT
 * propagate would do the opposite of the goal — it would abort a tool call that had
 * already succeeded, from inside the code meant to remember that it succeeded.
 *
 * The one write that is *awaited* is `begin`, and only because its whole purpose is to
 * exist before the tool runs. Everything else is fire-and-forget: the loop must not
 * wait on a round trip between a result and its handoff.
 *
 * ⚠️ Everything goes through `ledger-client`, which messages the background. Do **not**
 * reach for `@/shared/db` here: it does not work in a content script, and since `begin`
 * is awaited, the failure mode is *every* tool call hanging for 30 seconds — including
 * ones that touch no data. See the note at the top of `ledger-client.ts`.

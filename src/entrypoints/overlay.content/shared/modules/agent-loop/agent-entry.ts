 * Agent entries — what the `>` popup and the Agent tab launcher offer.

 * ## It used to be skills, and now it is agents
 *
 * The list has been through two shapes. First there were two triggers: `>` picked a skill,
 * `!` ran without one. Then one list whose first row was "let the AI decide" and whose rest
 * were skills. Now it is **one row per agent**, and skills are gone from it entirely.
 *
 * Why: picking a skill up front meant committing to an approach before seeing any data, and
 * the wrong guess cost the whole session — a run started from "Export Conversations" that
 * turned out to need a sync had to be abandoned. The running agent calls `activate_skill`
 * itself now, once it knows what the task actually is.
 *
 * What the user chooses instead is genuinely a decision only they can make: **which of
 * their things this is about.** Their conversations, or their files.

/**
 * Auto-pickup — running tool calls the user never asked us to run.
 *
 * The situation: a task finished, the user carried on typing in the same chat instead of
 * retyping `>`, and the AI answered in tool format anyway because it still remembers the
 * system prompt. Nobody is watching that response, so without this it just sits there —
 * the user sees an answer full of tool calls, no cards, no dock, and nothing happening.
 *
 * Shared between platforms on purpose. Every guard below is scar tissue from a specific
 * incident, and a second copy is a second place to relearn all of them; the AI Studio
 * feature went without pickup entirely at first and reproduced the original bug exactly.
 * The only platform-specific part is *how you read the newest model turn*, which the
 * caller supplies.

   * there, no results follow them, `executedCalls` is empty. So pickup used to
   * re-execute — and for a write, that is the same statement applied twice. Worse, the
   * second run asks for approval again, on a statement the user just approved, so the
   * interface actively invites the duplicate. What those results need is delivering,
   * which the dock offers separately (see `owed`); re-running is never the recovery.
   *
   * ⚠️ Writes only, and the narrowing is the point. Identity is name-plus-params, so an
   * ordinary repeated question — "show me the biggest chats again" — produces
   * byte-identical SQL to one the conversation already ran, and the guard read that as
   * the double-write it is here to stop. The response was skipped whole: statements never
   * ran, no results, nothing sent, and the transcript closed with a tick. On a follow-up
   * after a finished task this was easy to hit, because the AI naturally reaches for the
   * query it just used.
   *
   * Re-running a read costs a query and can't corrupt anything, so it is the cheaper
   * mistake by a wide margin. A write still gets the full stop, matched per call rather
   * than per response — one recorded write disqualifies the response, since pickup
   * replays it as a unit and cannot leave that one statement out.

   * stored rows for everything before the last reload.

/**
 * The sync run — a script that drives the tab, not a request that returns a value.
 *
 * Shape of the thing, because it is unusual for a tool: there is no API to ask for a
 * conversation's messages. The only way to get them is to be *on* the page while
 * Gemini fetches them, so the run moves the tab to each conversation in turn, scrolls
 * its history to the top, and lets the existing interceptor → background → DB path
 * record whatever comes back.
 *
 * Moving between conversations goes through Gemini's own router (`shared/lib/navigation`
 * — a sidebar click when the conversation is in the list, pushState otherwise), the same
 * path the explorer uses. That keeps one JS context alive for the whole run, which is
 * what makes the two things a minutes-long background job needs possible at all:
 *
 * - a progress indicator that stays put (`sync-progress.ts`)
 * - a Stop button that takes effect now rather than at the next page boot
 *
 * A full page load is kept only as the fallback for a conversation the router refuses
 * to open, so the job is still persisted in `chrome.storage.local` and the run is still
 * resumable across a reload or a closed tab:
 *
 *   startSyncRun()   write the job, then start driving
 *   driveJob()       navigate → wait → scroll → record → advance the cursor
 *   (reload, if any) resumeSyncRun() at overlay start-up picks the job back up
 *   finish           save a report, return to where the run started, toast the result
 *
 * The consequence the caller has to own: the agent session cannot survive this. The
 * agent's own conversation is one of these pages, and we are about to leave it. That
 * is why `sync_conversation_messages` is a handoff tool (see
 * `engine/parser/tool-schema.ts`) — it ends the loop by design, and the AI is told to
 * explain what is about to happen *before* calling it.

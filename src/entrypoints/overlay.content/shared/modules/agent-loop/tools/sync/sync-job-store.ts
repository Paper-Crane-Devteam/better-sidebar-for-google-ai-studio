 * Persisted state for a message-sync run.

 * A run walks the tab through one conversation after another. It does that through
 * Gemini's own router, so the driver normally keeps running in memory the whole way —
 * but a run lasts minutes, and the two things that end it early are exactly the two
 * things memory can't survive: the tab being closed, and the full page load the runner
 * falls back to when the router won't open a conversation. So the cursor is written to
 * `chrome.storage.local` before each move and read back at overlay start-up.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately kept here rather than in the agent store:
 * - the job outlives the agent session (the session ends the moment we navigate)
 * - the report, so the "synced N conversations" toast can be shown even if the run
 *   crossed a page load on its way out

/**
 * `doc_read` and `doc_edit` — the agent's way into Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF and
 * subtitle files.
 *
 * Same contract as the workspace tools next door: never throws, a failure is
 * `ERROR: <what to do about it>`, every parameter arrives as a string and is coerced
 * here.
 *
 * ## The result is shaped by the round budget, not by what is in the file
 *
 * All tool output in a round shares 29998 characters (`engine/stages/handoff/budget.ts`),
 * and going over is *silently truncated* — the payload leaves the composer looking
 * complete. A thesis is several times that budget on its own, and a 5000×20 worksheet is
 * thirty times it, so this tool answers with an outline first and only ever returns a slice
 * of the content. That is why `mode` defaults to `outline` rather than to "the document".
 *
 * ⚠️ The projection deliberately carries no inline Markdown. The text the agent reads
 * here is text it will later quote back to locate an edit, and a `**` inserted for
 * emphasis would make that quote fail to match the real characters in the file.

/**
 * Watching `GenerateContent` as it streams.
 *
 * Every other interceptor here works off `onResponse`, which ajax-hook fires at
 * `readyState 4`. That is the wrong moment for this one request: it is the only
 * AI Studio endpoint that streams, and waiting for it to close is what left the
 * agent view a turn behind.
 *
 * The incremental hook comes from ajax-hook's own request config rather than a
 * second patch of `window.XMLHttpRequest`: `proxy()` sets `config.xhr` to the real
 * XHR in its `open` handler, before `onRequest` runs (see `xhr-proxy.js`). Adding a
 * `readystatechange` listener there is ordinary DOM, touches nothing global, and
 * leaves the existing `onResponse` path exactly as it was — `UpdatePrompt` still
 * delivers the authoritative transcript, this just gets there first.

/**
 * Background → document worker, one round trip.
 *
 * Much smaller than the DB bridge next door, and the reason is worth stating: **document
 * requests are stateless.** Every one carries its own workspace id and path, so there is
 * no equivalent of `INIT`, no "which database is open", no replay, no session lock. A
 * worker that was just rebuilt is immediately as useful as one that has been up for an
 * hour.
 *
 * ⚠️ Only reads are retried. A dropped `doc_edit` might have been dropped *after* the
 * write landed, and replaying it would apply the same change twice — for a tracked-change
 * edit that means two overlapping revisions on one sentence, which is worse than the
 * failure it was trying to paper over.
 *
 * ⚠️ Must be called from the background. It routes through `runtime.sendMessage` to the
 * offscreen document; a content script would get no reply, because responses come back
 * over `sendMessage` and those never reach content scripts (the same trap documented in
 * `agent-loop/ledger-client.ts`).

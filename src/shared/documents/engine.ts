/**
 * The document engine's entry point — one function, called by the worker.
 *
 * Sequences the three things a document operation needs: pick a handler, load the
 * bytes, and (for an edit) hand the result to `saveDocument` so it lands safely. All the
 * format knowledge is behind `handlerFor`, and all the I/O is here or in `storage.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ This module must run at the extension origin — it opens OPFS. In practice that
 * means the doc worker inside the offscreen document (or the fallback worker on
 * Firefox). Calling it from a content script would silently address
 * `gemini.google.com`'s storage, which is empty, and every read would report "not
 * found" for a file the user can see in the tree.

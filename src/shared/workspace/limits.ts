/**
 * What the free tier gets of the workspace.
 *
 * One workspace, five files. Deliberately not zero: the workspace is a sandbox of newly
 * created content, so the read/write line that guards the *database* — where a write
 * changes something the user already owns — has nothing to protect here. What is worth
 * selling is scale, so that is what the numbers cap. A free user can watch the agent
 * write a file, read it, edit it, and export it, which is the whole demo.
 *
 * ## Enforced at the callers, not in `fs.ts`
 *
 * Same placement as the SQL paywall: the tool layer decides, the filesystem executes.
 * `fs.ts` runs in the background service worker, where the licence store is not
 * hydrated, and pushing the check down there would also mean every internal move and
 * rename had to opt out of it.
 *
 * This is a limit, not a security boundary — OPFS is the user's own disk. It exists to
 * make the paid tier legible, so every check here fails *open* on an error rather than
 * refusing an operation because it could not count.

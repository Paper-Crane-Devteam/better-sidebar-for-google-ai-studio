/**
 * Workspace client — the content script's view of the filesystem.
 *
 * A thin typed wrapper over `browser.runtime.sendMessage({ type: 'WORKSPACE_FS' })`.
 * It exists so callers read like ordinary file calls instead of assembling message
 * payloads, and so the "must not run OPFS here" rule has exactly one place it could be
 * violated (it isn't: nothing in this file touches `navigator.storage`).
 *
 * ## Bound to a workspace, by construction
 *
 * `forWorkspace(id)` returns a client fixed to one workspace, rather than every method
 * taking an id. Two reasons: a caller cannot forget to pass it, and the id is resolved
 * once at the top of an operation instead of per call — so a multi-step tool cannot
 * have its second call land somewhere else.
 *
 * Deliberately no default client. Which workspace applies depends on the conversation's
 * binding, which lives in the agent module; `shared/` must not reach into that, so the
 * caller resolves it and passes it in.
 *
 * Every method rejects with a plain `Error` carrying the background's already
 * translated message, so tools can put `e.message` straight into their result text.

/**
 * Storage for what the agent did — sessions and tool calls.
 *
 * The split against the conversation is deliberate: the transcript remains the record
 * of what was *said*, and these tables hold only what cannot be recovered from it.
 * Two things qualify. Whether a call actually ran, which used to be inferred by
 * matching result labels back to calls, and whether a result ever reached the AI,
 * which nothing recorded at all — so a reload after an approved write left the write
 * done, the result destroyed with the composer, and the page ready to run it again.
 *
 * Every write here is best-effort by design (see `records.ts` in the agent module):
 * losing a row degrades the UI back to reading the transcript, whereas letting a
 * failed INSERT throw would take down a tool call that otherwise succeeded.

🔒 PRIVACY FIRST

We take your privacy seriously.

• 100% Local: We use an embedded SQLite database running entirely within your browser.
• No Cloud Sync: Your folders, tags, and notes are NOT sent to our servers.
• No Training: We do not read your conversations to train any AI models.

WHY DOES THE EXTENSION NEED PERMISSIONS?

We require access to aistudio.google.com solely to inject the enhanced sidebar interface and read chat titles for organization. We do not access your other browsing history.

• No Training: We do not read your conversations to train any AI models.

WHY DOES THE EXTENSION NEED PERMISSIONS?

We require access to aistudio.google.com and gemini.google.com solely to inject the enhanced sidebar interface and read chat titles for organization. We do not access your other browsing history.

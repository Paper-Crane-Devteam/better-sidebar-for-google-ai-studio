# Contributing to Better Sidebar for Google AI Studio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Better Sidebar!

While the source code for this extension is **closed-source**, we highly value community feedback, bug reports, and feature suggestions. This repository is the central place for that collaboration.

## How Can You Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs

This is one of the most important ways you can help. If you find a bug, please let us know!

*   **Search existing issues** to see if the bug has already been reported.
*   If not, open a new issue using the **Bug Report** template.
*   Provide as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, screenshots, and your environment.

### 2. Suggesting Features

We want to build the features that YOU need.

*   Use the **Feature Request** template to submit your ideas.
*   Explain *why* you want the feature and how it would improve your workflow.
*   Engage in discussions on other feature requests. Upvote the ones you like!

### 3. Documentation
